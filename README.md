# My Web Portfolio
A website I made entirely from scratch. I used Figma for creating a mock-up of the site and Angular to bring said mock-up to life, using 100% custom CSS.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to showcase my front-end developer skills to potential employers. The website takes advantage of Angular's modularity and scalability while keeping a clean file structure and code.

## Creative Process
The project was made and completed in the course of a week. 
1. Using Figma and my knowledge of design fundamentals, I designed a simple yet beautiful UI for mobile and desktop that represents my brand as a professional. 
2. Taking the design and Angular capabilities into account, I conceptualized the structure of the site: how I would break down the different UI elements into Angular components, the behavior of said elements, et cetera.
3. I created the basic modules and components I would need and wrote the basic HTML structure.
4. I applied styling using SCSS, following a mobile-first approach, as I worked my way up with the different resolutions. The final product was a responsive design that would work in all kinds of modern devices.
5. Using TypeScript I wrote the animations and the logic of the website.
6. Using Cloudflare I configured my DNS for <a href="https://jemarhe.com">jemarhe.com</a>, and finally deployed the website using GitHub Pages.
